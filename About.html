<h2>Testimonial</h2>

<p>"Ruth was a part of our team for several months and I am hard-pressed to think of someone I've worked with who has a better attitude than Ruth. She earned a spot with polite persistence and advocacy for herself and then played every role we asked of her with the same great poise. She is a skilled graphic designer who takes instruction very well. I had such a wonderful time having Ruth as a teammate and I would highly recommend her to anyone in need of her skills and a great person to work alongside." </p>
